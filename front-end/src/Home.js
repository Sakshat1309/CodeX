        <h2>What is a Compliance Report</h2>
        <p>A compliance report is the documented evidence you must produce to auditors to prove your company is compliant with the requirements put in place by a government and regulatory agency under a particular regulation.

   Compliance reports determine the compliance initiatives that have been effectively undertaken and the areas that need to be worked on to ensure full compliance. Besides being used as proof for submission to auditors, compliance reports can be utilized to make better decisions about risk management, allocation of resources and additional measures with respect to compliance.

   Neither compliance nor the generation of compliance reports are one-and-done affairs. As standards, reporting requirements and threats evolve, businesses are required to generate the necessary reporting to meet the requirements of various compliance regulations.

        <h2>What are the different types of compliance reports?</h2>
        <p>
        Compliance reports can be built in various forms with a focus on several key business matters. Most have a pre-determined structure based on the requirements of a specific industry standard or regulation. Some of the most common types focus on key aspects such as the security of sensitive data (cybersecurity/IT), financial records, health and safety, payroll, human resources, management standards, etc.
